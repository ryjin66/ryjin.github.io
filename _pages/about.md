I have been a Ph.D. student of management science and engineering in the Department of Industrial Engineering and Management at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), and advised by [Prof. Jie Song](http://www2.coe.pku.edu.cn/faculty/songjie/indexen.html) (PKU) since Sep. 2019. Before that, I got my B.E. degree in aerospace engineering at PKU in 2019. I ever visited CMS (Computing and Mathematical Sciences) at California Institute of Technology as a visiting scholar (Dec. 2022-Dec. 2023) and was advised by [Prof. Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/).

## Research Area
My research interests lie in the modeling and optimization of multiagent systems. The techniques mainly include multiagent reinforcement learning, zeroth-order optimization, and simulation-based optimization. The applications include demand side management, renewable energy integration, and energy storage planning & operation in low-carbon systems.
