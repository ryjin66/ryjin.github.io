I have been a Ph.D. student of management science and engineering in the Department of Industrial Engineering and Management at Peking University since Sep. 2019. Before that, I got my B.E. degree in aerospace engineering at PKU in 2019. Currently, I am visiting CMS (Computing and Mathematical Sciences) at California Institute of Technology as a visiting scholar (Dec. 2022-Now).

My research interests lie in modeling and optimization for multiagent systems. The techniques mainly include multiagent reinforcement learning, zeroth-order optimization, and simulation-based optimization. The applications include demand side management, renewable energy integration, and energy storage planning & operation in low-carbon systems.
